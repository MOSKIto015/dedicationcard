                    <p>Every time I see something that reminds me of you, I felt sad.</p>
                    <p>I remember the first time I saw you,</p>
                    <p>I thought it was nothing, just an ordinary classmate.</p>
                    <p>The nth time I saw you, I wanna be your friend.</p>
                    <p>A friend that I can annoy during class.</p>
                    <p>A friend that will listen to me.</p>
                    <p>The next time I saw you, we were friends</p>
                    <p>Laughing, joking, teasing each other,</p>
                    <p>But the 10010110th time I saw you was different,</p>
                    <p>I could not stop thinking about you,</p>
                    <p>I felt something, something different.</p>
                    <p>Is there something more than friends?</p>
                    <p>As time passed by, I got a chance to know you more,</p>
                    <p>A girl who is amazing, caring, beautiful, and cute.</p>
                    <p>A girl who is simple but most importantly, a girl with a good heart.</p>
                    <p>I remember the time that we used to talk,</p>
                    <p>I remember the time were we spent our days in school</p>
                    <p>I remember the every moments that I’m with you,</p>
                    <p>I remember every steps I took while walking with you.</p>
                    <p>Did it all happen? Was that a dream? Is it too good for it to happen?</p>
                    <p>How can I rewrite the story? How will I reboot the story?</p>
                    <p>Can I continue and code the next part of the story? Just like where it all began</p>
                    <p>I am here to debug the things I’ve done wrong and make it right. </p>
                    <p>I am here to find and fix all the errors.</p>
                    <p>If rebooting and debugging will take time, </p>
                    <p>I will patiently code till I perfectly got the algorithm, and the price.</p>
